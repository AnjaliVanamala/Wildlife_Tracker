# Wildlife Tracker

I love using eBird for tracking my bird sightings, however, it's someone difficult to see specific trends in my sightings like the total number of a specific species I've seen, timings of my sightings. Additionally, I can't log species I see while walking that aren't birds. So I decided to do it myself. 


# Work in Progress

This project is a work in progress, but it can run and store sightings in the backend locally. 

# Running the program

```
 python .\app.py
 ```
 This will start the application, accessible on your local computer at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
